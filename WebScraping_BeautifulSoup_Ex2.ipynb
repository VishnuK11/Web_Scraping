Although the manager apologized to me and it was smooth there after.  Overall a decent option for Business travel if your work location is nearby and you priority is to avoid the traffic.\"], [\"I stayed in this hotel on 30th & 31st July 2019. I went to Hyderabad for business purposes and the hotel was booked by my office. On the day of checkin (on 30-07-19) I was allotted a very small room having a big column inside the room. Bath room was miserably small. It was small even for use of a kid also. Inside shower area I can hardly stand as the width of that area was as much as my shoulder width. On finding those, I requested the reception staff to change the room with a comfortable room, but they denied mentioning unavailability of any other room (which was also seems incorrect). How ever, next day (31-07-19) morning, one of my colleagues was checking out from that hotel, who was also staying there under the same terms and conditions applicable to me, but his room was quiet comfortable. Hence, I requested the front desk manager Mr. Sibu to allot me room which was being released by my colleague. But the manager refused my request very roughly. Practically he shouted on me saying he can't accept my request. Then I ask him to upgrade my room to a hi higher category room, which he again refused saying all of their rooms were sold out that day. Further, he told me that when I would be back from office at night then he would check if changing of room at all possible or not. But this time I didn't agree with him and requested him complete the formality of my check out and I will shift to other hotel. Then immediately the manager told me there was one room available and asked me to check the same whether that would be suitable for me or not. On viewing that room I found apparently that was ok but none of the lights were working in that room and wash basin & outlet of shower area was chocked due to which water was not passing out to the drain. I told the manager to rectify those issues before shifting my luggage in to that room. However, when I returned from my office late at night I found that above mentioned defects were neither rectified nor conveyed to the night shift Service engineer. Then at that late night Service person came to Service the defects and stay for another one hour to rectify the defects. I visited Hyderabad several times. Also I visited different cities all over the country. Some of them are metro cities some are non metro. But anywhere in any hotel I never found such arrogant non professional staffs and such untidy small rooms. This was really a pathetic experience. I will never think to stay in this hotel in future and also suggest everyone to avoid this hotel as there many other good decent hotel nearby that location with almost at par rates compared to this hotel.…\"]]}\n",
